								<p>I was a resolution-ist - sorta. I was one of the millions of people that sometime in January 2013 (I was late to the resolution game), resolved to get healthy, get active, get “attractive.” You know the type...the type of person that memes are made of. So time in January, I forked over my credit card number, signed up for a boxing gym, and began spending a scary amount of money on grocery trips that consisted of nothing more than chicken, egg whites, broccoli, and rice. (brown because #brownricematters)

								<p>Now, what actually led me to make this resolution of mine? Well, it wasn't an epic, exciting, or Hallmark worthy start...it all started with me waking up one morning and not being able to remember when the last time was that I had broken a sweat or the last time I had gone a day without cheesy fiesta potatoes from Taco Bell. Or their Mexican Pizza. Or their Mexican Pizza TOPPED with cheesy fiesta potatoes. You get the point...</p>

								<p>Anyways, after I made my resolution and had gone a few months on this new Taco Bell-less lifestyle, I thought I was living the healthy life. After all, I had said goodbye to TB, hello to bland ass food and because I was sweating my ass off during my workouts, thinking that I was going to die each time (insert twitter athlete joke). It was an all or nothing mentality...I cut out the "bad" cold turkey, and became obsessed with what I thought was considered "healthy". At the time however, I had no idea that I was just as unhealthy, if not unhealthier, than I was before I made my resolution.</p>

								<p>6 months later, around June, I became a resolution-ist once more. This time, however, I resolved to find balance. A trip earlier that month to visit my family led me to drop my "healthy" diet and basically eat enough to  make up for the years that I hand't gotten to eat Colombian food. Needless to say, I felt like shit...physically AND mentally. I wasn't exactly sure what balance meant…all I knew is that the way I was living my life, despite it being “health” oriented, was destroying who I was as a person. I mean, how stupid is it that I was DISTRAUGHT at having enjoyed my family, my culture, and my country's food after years of not visitng? All over falling offtrack from my crazy strict plan. All I knew was that the way I was living my life, despite it being “health” oriented, was killing my soul, guys. I realized that the reasons I trained the way I trained and ate the way I ate were because I hated my body. They say that the reason for our actions are more important than the actions themselves, and that couldn’t be more accurate. I was angry that I wasn’t seeing the results I wanted, the results I felt I deserved because after all, shouldn’t my body be changing faster because of the torture I was putting it through? And that is where I was wrong; there was the fault in my original plan. Who ever said that torture and health can co-exist? And so I changed my goal. It was no longer about losing weight and being skinny. It was now about finding strength and being happy...(To Be Continued...)</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p><i>This was how my life as a fitness person started. It's a story that continues on today, but I wanted to give an in depth look at how I went from someone who didn't even realize that working out was a thing, to being a Nationally Qualified Bikini Competitor, to now trying to find a happy medium between the previous two. I will continue sharing the rest of my fitness journey here on le bloggy blog, so make sure to stay tuned...if you want.</i>
